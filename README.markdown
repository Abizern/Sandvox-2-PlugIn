# Sandvox 2 PlugIn Project Template for Xcode 4

The documentation in the [Sandvox Developer's Guide](http://www.karelia.com/sandvox/help/z/Sandvox_Developers_Guide.html) for setting up a project to create a plug in is based upon using Xcode 3.

This is a custom template for Xcode 4 that creates a project with _most_ of these settings created.

I said _most_. Xcode 4 templates are quite different from Xcode 3 templates so I don't know how to do everything in a template quite yet.

## Installation

The directory for custom Xcode 4 projects is (you may need to create this):

    ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates

Under this create a folder that will identify your group of personal templates, in my case I've gone for `My Templates` and I've extracted these files under that, to give this:

    ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/Sandvox 2 PlugIn.xctemplate/

## Development

If you have any requests, bug reports or patches please send them to me.
